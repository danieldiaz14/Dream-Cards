# Dream-Cards

Dream Cards is a card game that is intended to be built and balanced by the community. The goal is create the tools needed for anyone to go on the website and start building their own cards and upload their ideas so the game can grow. There will be an online version that will be entirely built up by the community and a 2nd version you can download and create an entirely new game if you wish!


## How can I play?

The game is written in Javascript meaning you only need your browser to play the game and do not need to install anything.

## How can I contribute?
 
The game is written in Javascript so you need any IDE to write code for it, I recommend atom or microsoft visual code. The preferred method would be forking the repository and creating a pull request. While making it clear exactly what you are adding.

## Found a bug or balance suggestions?

Feel free to raise an issue or send me an email at danieldiaz129@gmail.com. The goal of this project is to have a community driven game and see how it develops. If the game is unbalanced or broken we as a community made it that way.


## How can I contribute without knowing how to code.

If you are an artist and want to contribute art for a card or the game in general please email danieldiaz129@gmail.com. If you have an idea for a card design use the editor to make one or if the editor doesn't support the idea you have please raise an issue and if the community agrees it will be added.
